# TODO

- Create a DSL to make the API even simpler.
- Create better tooling support for the DSL, eg: text editor extensions, notebook kernels etc.
- Improve performance even more by rewriting sections in c++ or by using some other means.
- Add support for other languages besides Python, such as Javascript, C++, Golang etc.
- Add better coloured output to the testing system than just highlighting inside jupyter notebooks.
- Add a docker container for testing both python 2 and python 3 versions and eventually all the other versions.
- Add a local notebook setup for development.

- Improve the documentation using this guide and others http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/documentation/
