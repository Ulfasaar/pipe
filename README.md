# pipe []

A beautiful, simple, fast framework for creating computation pipelines. 

## Features

- A simple way to create functionally orientated, data pipe based code. Making code easier to test and reason about.

- An easy way to create various forms of parallism in Python with just a few function calls. This will spread data agreggate it, sort it etc based on the function you use,
whilst still providing access to the lower level internal functions used so that you can roll your own solution if a suitable one isn't present.

- Pipes are executed lazily, they will only run once their open() function is called.

## Goals

- Minimalism
- Performance
- Portability
- Ease of integration

## Building from source

Since all the code is currently written in Python all you need to do is clone, or fork this repo and to install a python version of your choice.
The only modules that are currently used are standard python ones so nothing else needs to be installed. 

## Contributing

Work on this section is in progress however the intention is to be beginner friendly.
